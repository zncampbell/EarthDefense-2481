# EarthDefense-2481
Python side scrolling game

This was my semester project for Python. I created a sidescrolling game called "Earth Defense 2481". When you play the game, the clouds scroll right to left infinitely. You have control of the ship to move up/down/left/right and fire lasers. You start with 3 extra ships and 100% health. There are 2 types of spacecraft that come from right to left. One of the types is destroyed with only one shot and does not shoot lasers back at you. The other type takes multiple hits to destroy and will fire lasers at you. In addition to these, there are rockets that fire from the bottom of the screen to the top. There are health pickups and extra life pickups. If your health is at 100% and you pickup extra health, you get bonus points. All items and enemies are randomized on where they spawn. The levels are based on score. Moving up a level increases the speed of the enemies and makes the score values higher. I wanted the graphics to look like crafted cardboard cutouts. I created all of the graphics using Photoshop and Procreate on my iPad Pro.
